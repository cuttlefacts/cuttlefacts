# This is a (cluster) task that builds an image given the src repo as
# a resource, and a path as a param, and pushes it to the output image
# resource. This is adapted from
#     https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/blob/master/kaniko/kaniko.yaml
# in the following ways:
#
#  - made into a ClusterTask
#  - updated to the v1beta1 structure
#  - renamed to suit how I've named things in this repo
